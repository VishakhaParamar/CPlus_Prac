## Projects Overview

This repository contains a variety of small applications that illustrate the following:

- Basic game logic (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe)
- Mathematical functions (e.g., Gaussian calculations, Tower of Hanoi)
- Data sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort)
- Simple system simulations (e.g., banking systems, CGPA calculators)
- To-Do lists and quizzes
- Solutions to data structure and algorithm (DSA) problems (e.g., prime number checks)

## Key Topics Covered

The projects in this repository cover a wide range of C++ topics, including:

- Functions and their applications
- Standard template library (STL) usage
- Data structures (arrays, vectors, lists, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)
- Game logic and simple system design

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cpp-projects
   ```

3. Compile and run the desired project using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o project_name project_name.cpp
   ./project_name
   ```

Make sure you have a compatible C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang).
